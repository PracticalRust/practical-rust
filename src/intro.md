# Introduction

## Organization

Practical Rust is divided into macro topics, listed below. If you don't know what you're looking for, try reading through the descriptions of the various sections and see if one of them sounds similar to the problem you're trying to solve. If it does, click though to that section, where you'll find a more detailed summary.

- [Serialization:](/serialization) reading or writing native program data in an interoperable format (config files, sending data over a network, etc.)
- [Observability:](/observability) enabling the measurement and observation of program state over time.


## Not Covered

Practical Rust is not meant to be a beginners' guide to the language itself, but rather a guide to the ecosystem and common ways we solve common problems. If you're looking for information on learning the language itself, consider one of the following excellent resources:

- [The Rust Book][rust-book]: the de-facto beginners' guide to Rust.
- [Rust by Example][rust-by-example]: A collection of examples demonstrating the application of beginners' skills.
- [Rust API Guidelines][api-guidelines]: follow this to construct idiomatic Rust libraries
